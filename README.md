## Description 

### How this Plugin Works

#### Explanation (Kind of)

1. It takes the top-level admin menu items of _some_ plugins and moves these pages as _submenus_ to an already existing admin pages. For example the popular "The SEO Framework" plugin does not need a top-level item ‚Äì it's just ONE admin page ‚Äì and can reside under regular WordPress general settings without any issues. That's the main concept.
2. The currently "integrated" plugins were tested by myself if everything works. The functionaly of that specific plugin admin page must still work as submenu, if that is the case, moving makes total sense. I use this plugin/snippet for some years already without any issues and I developed it for myself.
3. Only plugins get integrated where it makes sense: It must be the only admin page that this specific plugin has, and there should be relevant stuff on it. Promotional upsell/marketing/dashboard pages could be "removed" (even via CSS), these do _need_ to be moved.
4. The "moving" is just a simple WordPress default function, nothing special. There are no settings, not settings page itself, nothing of this stuff. It's all totally lightweight and simple and elegant. You can activate the plugin / snippet at any time.

## Custom Tweaks

#### via Filter (for developers):

The filter `ddw-psm/plugins` allows you to tweak the array of plugins: add more plugins, remove some of the defaults, or change parameters of the defaults.

Typical usage:
```
add_filter( 'ddw-psm/plugins', 'prefix_your_custom_function' );
function prefix_your_custom_function( $plugins ) {

	// do your stuff
	
	return $plugins;
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### Why did you create this plugin?
Because I needed (and wanted!) it myself for the sites I maintain. [Read the backstory here ...](#plugins-backstory)

### Why is this plugin not on wordpress.org plugin repository?
Because the restrictions there for plugin authors are becoming more and more. It would be possible but I don't want that anymore. The same for limited support forums for plugin authors on .org. I have decided to leave this whole thing behind me.

## Plugin's Backstory

_I wanted and needed the functionality of this plugin (Plugin Submenu Mover) myself so I developed it. For years alreay, I was annoyed by plugins putting their single admin pages on the top-level menu position in the WordPress Admin Area. This clutters your admin and takes away precious space, especially when you are on the smaller notebook on the go. This needed to be more streamlined. Formerly I mostly did specific code snippets for each of these plugins but I thought this could be done more elegant. So this code snippet was born and later on being made as plugin as well. This code already works in the installs I maintain for some years and is battle tested._

‚Äì‚Äì David Decker, plugin developer, in March of 2025

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons (ah, thanks, Matt!).

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Have fun building great sites!!! ;-)
