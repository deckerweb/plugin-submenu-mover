--> Please decide for one of both alternatives!

## How this Plugin Works

1. It takes the top-level admin menu items of _some_ plugins and moves these pages as _submenus_ to an already existing admin pages. For example the popular "The SEO Framework" plugin does not need a top-level item â€“ it's just ONE admin page â€“ and can reside under regular WordPress general settings without any issues. That's the main concept.
2. The currently "integrated" plugins were tested by myself if everything works. The functionaly of that specific plugin admin page must still work as submenu, if that is the case, moving makes total sense. I use this plugin/snippet for some years already without any issues and I developed it for myself.
3. Only plugins get integrated where it makes sense: It must be the only admin page that this specific plugin has, and there should be relevant stuff on it. Promotional upsell/marketing/dashboard pages could be "removed" (even via CSS), these do _need_ to be moved.

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons (ah, thanks, Matt!).

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Have fun building great sites!!! ;-)
